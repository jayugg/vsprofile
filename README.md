# vsprofile â€“ Simple CLI mod manager for Vintage Story
This is a simple `C++` project with mostly pedagogical value.
It is my first project with the language so expect bugs.

The current implementation simply allows stashing the contents of the mods
folder into `Profiles` stored elsewhere and quickly swap them around. 
This is how I always managed my mods manually, so it felt like a good starter
`C++` project.

In the future, I plan to add a simple delta-debugging tool to help debug crashes
and mod conficts.
