# vsprofile â€“ Simple CLI mod manager for Vintage Story
This is a simple `C++` starter project which automates how I manually handle mods.
It is my first project in the language so expect bugs.

The current implementation simply allows stashing the contents of the mods
folder into `Profiles` stored elsewhere and quickly swap them around. 

In the future, I plan to add a simple delta-debugging tool to help debug crashes
and mod conficts.
